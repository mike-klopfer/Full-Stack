## Computing Environment

Some stuff here about the environment

### Package management

### Shell

### Version Control

* Git for version control
* The following are recommended general Git commit practices:
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative (command) mood in the subject line
  + A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complet the following sentence: If applied, this commit will *[your subject line here]*
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
* Here's how a commit message might look:  
```
Imperative commit title limited to 50 characters
# Blank line
- More detailed commit message body
- List of key points and updates that the commit provides
- Lines need to be manually wrapped at 72 characters
```

## Strategies

### Projects

* **Focus on projects.** This is where the majority of the learning will happen...by having to write your own code mostly or completely from scratch. 

* **Master Markdown.**
  + Markdown is a simplified HTML syntax that is useful for notes and documentation
  + Practicing Markdown will enable you to become fluent in a simple syntax.
  + Helpful VSCode resources

* **Keep Computational narratives.**
  * A computational narrative is a written description of the step-by-step process used to generate a set of code which solves a given computational or coding problem. 
  * These narratives capture the train of thought, so that the programmer can retrace their steps and more easily retain what they have learned along the way
* **Break projects down into actionable steps.**
  * ...and write a module or function which solves each step
  * This is a key skill. As a developer you will need to write code which solves a large task with no clear guidance on how to proceed
  * Break the project down into steps, and make the steps headers in the computational narratives
  * To give us an overview of the project in Markdown when looking at our computational narratives, we can create a table of contents from the headers, using the "Create Table of Contents" feature of the Markdown All In One VSCode extension.
  * As we work, include code in Markdown fenced code blocks with ```
